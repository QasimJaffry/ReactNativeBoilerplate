# React Native Template


This project is a React Native boilerplate that can be used to kickstart a mobile application.

The boilerplate provides an optimized architecture for building solid cross-platform mobile applications through separation of concerns between the UI and business logic. It is fully documented so that each piece of code that lands in your application can be understood and used.


# Requirements
Node 14 or greater is required. Development for iOS requires a Mac and Xcode 10 or up, and will target iOS 11 and up.

You also need to install the dependencies required by React Native.
Go to the React Native environment setup, then select React Native CLI Quickstart tab.
Follow instructions for your given development OS and target OS.
